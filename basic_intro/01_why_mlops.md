# Why MLOps? 🤖🚀

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of combining **Machine Learning** and **DevOps** principles to automate and streamline the ML lifecycle, from data preparation to model deployment and monitoring.

## 🔍 The Need for MLOps

Without MLOps, ML projects face several critical challenges:

- 🔁 **Reproducibility Issues** — Models trained today might not work tomorrow due to environment, data, or dependency changes.
- ⚙️ **Manual and Error-Prone Processes** — Data scientists often manage models manually, leading to inconsistencies.
- 🔄 **Inefficient Model Updates** — Updating a model in production is slow and lacks automation.
- 🛠️ **Poor Collaboration** — Lack of integration between data scientists and engineering teams.
- 📉 **Unmonitored Models** — Once deployed, models may degrade in performance without being noticed.

## 🧱 MLOps Lifecycle Stages

1. **Data Engineering** — Ingest, clean, and store data
2. **Model Development** — Build, train, and validate models
3. **Model Versioning** — Track and store model versions
4. **Model Deployment** — Serve models via APIs or batch jobs
5. **Monitoring** — Track model performance, drift, and feedback
6. **Automation** — Use pipelines for reproducibility and CI/CD
