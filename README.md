# MLOps

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps workflow using the classic Iris dataset. It includes a manual implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, along with proper model evaluation, versioning, and reproducibility techniques.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Implement k-NN classifier from scratch.
- Train and evaluate on the Iris dataset.
- Track experiments and metrics using MLOps tools.
- Version control data and models.
- Build a reproducible and scalable ML pipeline.
