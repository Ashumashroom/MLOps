# Why We Need Docker for MLOps and How to Initialize It

## ðŸ“Œ Why Docker is Important for MLOps

Docker is a **containerization** tool that packages your application code, dependencies, and environment into a single, portable unit called a **container**.  
In **MLOps**, Docker plays a crucial role because:

1. **Reproducibility**  
   - Ensures the same environment for development, testing, and production.  
   - No more "works on my machine" issues.

2. **Portability**  
   - A Docker container can run anywhereâ€”your laptop, a cloud VM, Kubernetes clusterâ€”without modification.

3. **Dependency Management**  
   - ML projects often depend on specific library versions (e.g., TensorFlow 2.6, CUDA 11.2).  
   - Docker stores these dependencies in the container image.

4. **Isolation**  
   - Keeps ML experiments isolated so that changes in one project donâ€™t break another.

5. **Integration with CI/CD**  
   - In MLOps pipelines, Docker ensures your training, validation, and deployment steps use identical environments.

6. **Easier Collaboration**  
   - Share your ML setup by just sharing the Docker image.
